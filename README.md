# Job Portal Dashboard

## Description
This project is a simple frontend application designed to demonstrate skills in web development, including responsive design, dynamic content rendering, and AJAX functionality.

The dashboard allows users to browse job opportunities, apply filters, and toggle between light and dark themes.

## Features
1. **Responsive Design**:
    - The layout is optimized for various screen sizes and devices.

2. **Filters**:
    - **By Job Title**: Filter job listings based on their titles.
    - **By Location**: Filter job listings based on their locations.

3. **Dark Mode**:
    - Toggle between light and dark themes for better accessibility and user preference.

4. **Dynamic Job Card Generation**:
    - Job cards are dynamically created using data from a JSON file.
    - Logos, shapes, and colors are also pulled from the JSON data for customization.

5. **AJAX for Data Updates**:
    - Filters trigger dynamic updates to the job list without page reloads.

6. **Interactive Job Description (In Progress)**:
